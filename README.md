## Version Manager

To manage NodeJS versions, we decided to use [`asdf`](https://asdf-vm.com/) over `volta`.

The `asdf` utility is a language-agnost version manager. It is akin to python version management utilities like `conda`. We tried using `volta` first, but we kept running into errors when trying to pin a specific NodeJS version to the project.

As a result, we switched to `asdf`.

If preferred, it is entirely possible to use a system-level NodeJS installation for development. In this case, `npm` or `yarn` or some other *package* manager should be used. 

**TODO:** instructions for setting up project using system-wide NodeJS.

## Install `asdf`

### macOS and `zsh`

Follow the [asdf getting started guide](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html).  
1. Run `brew install asdf`
1. Configure `asdf`
1. Add to `.zshrc`: `export PATH="${ASDF_DATA_DIR:-$HOME/.asdf}/shims:$PATH"`
1. Install the [asdf plugin for zsh](https://github.com/kiurchv/asdf.plugin.zsh)

**Using `oh-my-zsh` plugin**

There was difficulty in getting the `asdf` plugin working as an antigen bundle. 
Consequently, we opted to use the `asdf` plugin for `oh-my-zsh` instead.

Clone the `asdf` plugin repo:  
```
git clone https://github.com/kiurchv/asdf.plugin.zsh $HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/asdf
```

Then load the plugin in `.zshrc` by adding the following line:  
```
plugins+=(asdf)
```

Setup `asdf` autocompletion by addin the following lines to the bottom of `.zshrc`:  
```
# append completions to fpath
fpath=(${ASDF_DATA_DIR:-$HOME/.asdf}/completions $fpath)

# initialise completions with ZSH's compinit
autoload -Uz compinit && compinit
```

### Use NodeJS with `asdf`

Install the latest NodeJS via the CLI using `asdf`:  
```
# Add plugin to asdf
asdf plugin add nodejs

# Install the latest available version
asdf install nodejs latest
```

Create the meetdown project using `npx`:  
```
# Move into directory where project will be stored
cd ~/projects

# Set the latest version in .tool-versions of the `current directory`
asdf set nodejs latest

# Create the meetdown project and its corresponding directory using the latest NodeJS
npx create-next-app@latest -e with-supabase
```

This should create the `~/projects/meetdown` directory.


# NextJS with Supabase

## Features

- Works across the entire [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) stack
  - App Router
  - Pages Router
  - Middleware
  - Client
  - Server
  - It just works!
- supabase-ssr. A package to configure Supabase Auth to use cookies
- Styling with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- Components with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- Optional deployment with [Supabase Vercel Integration and Vercel deploy](#deploy-your-own)
  - Environment variables automatically assigned to Vercel project

## Demo

You can view a fully working demo at [demo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app](https://demo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app/).

## Deploy to Vercel

Vercel deployment will guide you through creating a Supabase account and project.

After installation of the Supabase integration, all relevant environment variables will be assigned to the project so the deployment is fully functioning.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fnext.js%2Ftree%2Fcanary%2Fexamples%2Fwith-supabase&project-name=nextjs-with-supabase&repository-name=nextjs-with-supabase&demo-title=nextjs-with-supabase&demo-description=This+starter+configures+Supabase+Auth+to+use+cookies%2C+making+the+user%27s+session+available+throughout+the+entire+Next.js+app+-+Client+Components%2C+Server+Components%2C+Route+Handlers%2C+Server+Actions+and+Middleware.&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fdemo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app%2F&external-id=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fnext.js%2Ftree%2Fcanary%2Fexamples%2Fwith-supabase&demo-image=https%3A%2F%2Fdemo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app%2Fopengraph-image.png)

The above will also clone the Starter kit to your GitHub, you can clone that locally and develop locally.

If you wish to just develop locally and not deploy to Vercel, [follow the steps below](#clone-and-run-locally).

## Clone and run locally

1. You'll first need a Supabase project which can be made [via the Supabase dashboard](https://database.new)

2. Create a Next.js app using the Supabase Starter template npx command

   ```bash
   npx create-next-app --example with-supabase with-supabase-app
   ```

   ```bash
   yarn create next-app --example with-supabase with-supabase-app
   ```

   ```bash
   pnpm create next-app --example with-supabase with-supabase-app
   ```

3. Use `cd` to change into the app's directory

   ```bash
   cd with-supabase-app
   ```

4. Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local` and update the following:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=[INSERT SUPABASE PROJECT URL]
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[INSERT SUPABASE PROJECT API ANON KEY]
   ```

   Both `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` can be found in [your Supabase project's API settings](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/api)

5. You can now run the Next.js local development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The starter kit should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

6. This template comes with the default shadcn/ui style initialized. If you instead want other ui.shadcn styles, delete `components.json` and [re-install shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/next)

> Check out [the docs for Local Development](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/local-development) to also run Supabase locally.
